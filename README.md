### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cris, I'm a software engineer student with a double degree in industrial engineering. Iâ€™m passionate about tech development and the great impact it could have if we use it in the right way and put it at disposal of society.

I have developed knowledge and domain mainly in data science and software development. I love learning new things and challenging myself for improvement in a complete way, both professionally and personally. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: saxophone, french, and Next.js.
