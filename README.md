### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cris, I'm a software engineer student with a double degree in industrial engineering. Iâ€™m passionate about tech development and the great impact it could have if we use it in the right way and put it at disposal of society.

I have developed knowledge and domain in topics like automation, data science, software development, and machine learning. Also, I love learning new things and challenging myself for improvement in a complete way, both professionally and personally.
